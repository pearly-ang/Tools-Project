# Tools-Project

Group 39 - Section 2

Objective:
Assessing the heat and drought resistance of different crops by predicting their yield in certain situations

Approach:
Stage 1: Data cleaning and data preprocessing - We merged on the type of crop ('HYBRID_ID') and cleaned the performance and weather datasets to produce a complete dataset.

Stage 2: Data visualization - Next, we did exploratory data analysis on our combined dataset, producing folium maps and, specific correlation matrices and graphs.

Stage 3: Machine learning and modelling - Finally, we ran the Decision Tree Regressor model and noted specific feature importances as well as the accuracy of our predictive metric.

The project is consolidated in one single notebook -> TFA_Project_Master.ipynb 
The python packages required to run the notebook are listed in -> requirements.txt


Additional File:
Linear_Regressions.ipynb is a more extensive file on the iterations needed to get to the final models
